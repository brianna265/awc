          <h2>A student-run, non-profit organization</h2>
          <p>
            For over <b>20 years</b>, we have worked to promote the recruitment 
          and retention of women in technology and computer-oriented professions.
          This mission is more critical now than ever, as the percentage of women
          pursuing a Computer Science degree is less than <b>25% nationally</b>,
           and below <b>25% at Virginia Tech</b>. Toward restoring diversity, we
          work with the close support of the Department of Computer Science, 
          affiliated CSRC and other IT companies, and the College of
          Engineering.
