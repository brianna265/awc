          <h1>Women in Computing Day</h1>
          <p>Every spring, the Association for Women in Computing hosts 
              <b> Women in Computing Day</b>, an outreach event introducing 
              6th- and 7th-grade girls to the exciting world of technology. 
              Now in its 22nd year, this program is a cornerstone of our 
              mission to inspire the next generation of women in tech. With 
              the male-to-female ratio in computing still disproportionately 
              low, this event provides early exposure.
          </p>
          <p>Throughout the day, participants explore four hands-on activities
              showcasing the breadth of computing, from coding with Snap to 
              building circuits with LEDs, designing apps, and even 
              experimenting with biotechnology. By sparking curiosity and 
              confidence at a young age, we aim to open doors to future 
              opportunities and help shape a more diverse and inclusive tech 
              community.
          </p>
